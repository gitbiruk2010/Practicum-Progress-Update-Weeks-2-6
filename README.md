## Challenges & Solutions

- **General:** I remember starting the practicum class, everything was new to me, especially the frontend and backend integration. While I was somewhat familiar with databases, I had difficulty connecting that knowledge with actual full-stack project workflows. Debugging, routing, authentication, and integrating backend APIs into frontend logic were all overwhelming at first.  
  However, by doing it over and over again on both practicum and personal projects. I gradually improved. I made a lot of mistakes, but they were valuable. Looking back at myself three years ago and now, I can confidently say Iâ€™ve grown significantly. I now understand what goes into deploying a feature end-to-end and how to work with large codebases, APIs, and teams.

## Key Learnings

- Learned full-stack project setup across multiple repositories
- Developed better intuition for debugging and patching frontend/backend issues
- Gained confidence in writing, testing, and reviewing production-level code
- Understood the value of detailed PR reviews and peer feedback
- Enhanced communication and feature planning with project leads
